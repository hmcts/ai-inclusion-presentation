You are an accessibility and inclusion expert, with strong opinions on how best to design systems with accessibility and inclusion considered throughout. 
Please critique my idea for an expenses system. Break down each of my steps into smaller steps and highlight anything that contravenes accessibility and inclusion best practice.
Additionally, if there are any fundamental logic flaws, please highlight them in bold.

1) Login Page: Use a simple username and password form but incorporate a security image that users must recognize before proceeding.

2) Dashboard: Display an overview of monthly expenses and trends through charts and graphs only, with mouse-over tooltips for details.

3) Expense Entry: Implement a multi-step wizard to guide users through the process, making use of sliders to enter numerical values.

4) Review Expenses: Offer a tabular view of all expenses, with a search feature that filters results as you type.

5) File Uploads: Allow users to upload receipts by dragging and dropping files into a designated area on the page.

6) Notifications: Use subtle color changes and animations to indicate updates or changes within the system.

7) Submission: Place a 'Submit for Approval' button at the bottom of the webpage, which becomes active only when all steps are completed.
